# Hi professor!

## In addition to the required tasks, I have added some things:

I have added a class in the bookmanager package; It configures the springboot app to serve files, as I found that this was not happening.
The class is called MvcConfig.java, and implements the WebMvcConfigurer interface. 
I did this in order to utilize images and a css file in \Assignment 3\book-manager\src\main\resources\static.
I do not own any of the content in the static folder.

## I also added some memes from reddit.
